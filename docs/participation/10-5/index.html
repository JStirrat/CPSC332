        <h1>Javascript</h1>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>I have very little experience with Javascript, but so far it seems like it is very similar to other programming languages i have used so i am not too worried</li>
            <li>The one thing i found surprising about javascript is that variables can be used without any keywords like let or var, since that is so different from any language i have used before, except maybe python. Other than that everything seemed to fall into what i expected, but that was one thing that really bypassed my expectations </li>
